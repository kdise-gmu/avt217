    <h2>Blaze Pizza</h2>
      <p>The Blaze Pizza website is clean and has effective spacing to make things feel comfortable and not cluttered. It looks like its on a 12-column grid (but its possible it could just be 4) with some sections breaking up into two parts and others going all the way across. I think one of the strongest aspects of the website is its use of color. The color scheme is is orange, white, and black, with orange and black being used heavily and black being more like an accent color. The photos of pizza of course contribute greatly to the effectiveness of color, because they too match the color scheme, especially the photos that have it on a white background.</p><br>

    <br><h2>Popeyes</h2>
      <p>Popeyes website uses a grid with elements of varying width placed at different parts. For example, some sections use 4 columns and others use 3; I think this variation is effective here in making a well-designed website. Their color scheme is white and orange with some black, which works well because it matches well with the color of the foods in their pictures. I think that overall their website works well and is well designed.</p><br>

    <br><h2>P.F. Chang's</h2>
      <p>The website of P.F. Chang’s is black and red with white accents and text. It uses an asymmetric grid spanning across the screen, with a symmetrical navigation bar under it, which I think balances out very well. Their website’s colors take a different approach than some of the other restaurants, in that they do not necessarily resemble the food of the restaurant. While that worked well for other places, I think P.F. Chang’s conveys something different with their colors: a mood. I believe that the way they used color does a lot to convey the idea that they want the restaurant to look “fancy” in a way or like its a classy place, and it wants people to see it as a more high-end place as opposed to casual.</p><br>

    <br><h2>Buca di Beppo</h2>
      <p>Buca di Beppo is an Italian restaurant and they have a color scheme that matches Italy’s flag colors, so it is fitting. Some parts of the website look like they could potentially be placed in a grid, but it is hard to tell because it was not done as well if so. While the website looks nice, much of it feels too big and like there’s a lot going on; it just feels very busy. I think it would benefit if it used white space more effectively and didn’t make stuff really big and “in your face.” Some websites, when viewed on a standard widescreen monitor, will have white space on the side and keep the content within the edges of the grid, while some make content extend all the way to the edge. Both can work in different scenarios, but going to the edges of the screen I personally think is harder to pull off well, and this is a situation where I think that it did not benefit them by doing so.</p><br>

    <br><h2>Bahama Breeze</h2>
      <p>The Bahama Breeze website has a very tropical feeling from the colors and photos, which is good because that’s the kind of image they want to have. The colors are a teal/turqoise color, blue, and a magenta-like color. There is a banner and navigation bar at the top of the screen, which goes to the edges, as well as a bottom banner when you scroll down that goes to the left and right edges of the screen. The content in the page in between these top and bottom banners is in a tall column with modules of rectangles and squares. This central content area doesn’t extend to the edges, but stays within the center third of the page. At first I wasn’t sure if this variation of edges was good or bad, but upon further thought I think it still works well because I realized that, while the top and bottom banners go to the edge, the content (logo, buttons) does not, but stays within the middle third of the page like the main content area.</p><br>
