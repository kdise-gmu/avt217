    <h1>Portfolio Critique</h1>
    <h2>Kate Moross</h2>
      <img src="crit_img/katemoross.png" alt="Kate Moross's website" width="1000 px">
        <footer>&#40;<a href="https://www.katemoross.com">www.katemoross.com</a>&#41;</footer>
      <p>Kate Moross’s website first presents the user with a very colorful collage of her work, which immediately conveys to the user the kind of designer Kate is and how well she uses bright, vibrant colors. Scrolling down brings you to a few categories with names for who to contact for them, like “General Enquiries,” “Talks & Lectures,” etc.  To the right is a small hamburger menu button, that when clicked opens a light yellow sidebar with links to other sections of their site. This yellow color, while a good fit for her content, unfortunately does not feel cohesive with the rest of the site’s design. Prior to this current design, the website used yellow much more heavily and was the main color of the site itself, but for the current design to work I think there need to either be more elements  accented yellow or have no yellow there at keep it neutral like a white or light gray. Of those two routes, I think adding more of a yellow accent may be more effective because it would help build a sense of brand identity.</p><br>

    <br><h2>Naiara Linhares</h2>
      <img src="crit_img/naiaralinhares.png" alt="Naiara Linhares's website" width="1000 px">
        <footer>&#40;<a href="https://www.naiaralinhares.com/">www.naiaralinhares.com</a>&#41;</footer>
      <p>Linhares’s website is hyper-minimalist and simple in every way. The home page has a handful of thumbnails of her work and hovering over them shows more information in a red box of white text about the project they are part of, and clicking on them takes you to a page that has more examples of her work from that project. The navigation menu consists of two links, “WORK” and “CONTACT,” and I think by keeping the navigation so simple it makes the site most effective to potential clients who want to see her work and contact her. By keeping things simple, her site is even more effective.</p><br>

      <br><h2>Cami Dobrin</h2>
        <img src="crit_img/camidobrin.png" alt="Cami Dobrin's website" width="1000 px">
          <footer>&#40;<a href="https://www.camidobrin.com/">www.camidobrin.com</a>&#41;</footer>
        <p>Dobrin’s website has the benefit of her portfolio work being very cohesive, so by keeping the site design itself rather minimal she was able to let her work speak for itself and make its own impression. For an accent color she chose a carrot orange, which works well with the color palette of her portfolio as well as her personal icon at the top, which has a small but noticeable pop of orange color in it. She categorized her work into two categories: “play” and “client, with “play” being her own personal work and “client” being (obviously) client work. I wonder if “play” was the best word to use here, however, as it doesn’t immediately tell visitors “this is my personal work.” Maybe she could have used the word “personal” or even another fun way of saying “non-commercial.” Overall the website is very successful, and her somewhat “under-designed” website I think is the perfect approach for her portfolio that has its own strong theme, palette, and identity.</p><br>

        <br><h2>Shantell Martin</h2>
          <img src="crit_img/shantellmartin2e.png" alt="Shantell Martin's website" width="1000 px">
            <footer>&#40;<a href="https://www.shantellmartin.com/">www.shantellmartin.com</a>&#41;</footer>
          <p>Shantell Martin’s website takes a maximalist approach and opens to a large whole-body photo of her laying down on top of a group covered in doodles, with her name written in bold above her head. The doodles around your mouse all “jiggle” around and within the doodles are a few navigational buttons disguised as written works, “work,” “news,” “info,” shop,” and a small “play” button that when clicked lets you edit the functionality of the background doodles (like how fast they move, the radius of how much stuff around your mouse moves, etc.). It’s not the most straightforward to navigate, but on the other hand it definitely stands out as unique and memorable. When clicking the navigation buttons, they zoom in and open up the contents, but I think having Shantell there so large in the page makes it a bit awkward and distracting when you actually view content because after it zooms in there’s a giant hand or leg on the side of the page. There’s also a hidden hamburger menu in next to her bold name at the top that can’t be seen from the landing page but it shows up once you are viewing a content category. When opened, it’s a black background with extremely bold, blocky type and rectangles leaving little negative space between anything on the left, and on the right it’s a more minimal list of links to some of her work. Overall, I think her site suffers in terms of navigation and usability but I think that it succeeds very well in making an impact and making it memorable to the user, which I think is what she was going for.</p><br>

          <br><h2>Mark Wheeler</h2>
            <img src="crit_img/markwheeler.png" alt="Mark Wheeler's website" width="1000 px">
              <footer>&#40;<a href="https://www.markwheeler.net/">www.markwheeler.net</a>&#41;</footer>
            <p>Mark Wheeler’s site takes a minimal approach and uses a white and orange theme. At the top is an area with a lot of white space that has his introduction and contact info, as well as a hamburger menu navigational button on the left top corner. Below this are large thumbnails of his work in an asymmetric grid. The grid items feel a bit too large and maybe even make it feel a bit cluttered; I think more white space either in margins or in between thumbnails might benefit it. The navigational menu, when opened, has a list of projects he’s worked on, but I don’t find it too effective since a new client wouldn’t know what to look for on the list except for the jobs with more famous companies. Overall I didn’t find his website to be as effective as it could have been, but that’s not to say it failed either, as some aspects did work very well, such as consolidating the bio and contact info into one small package that’s the first thing on the website.</p><br>
