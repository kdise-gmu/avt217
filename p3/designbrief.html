    <h1>Final Project Design Brief</h1>
    <p>The goal of the website is to present the portfolio of my work to prospective clients. I am a freelance graphic designer working in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area as well as a digital artist. It should have a summary of my past experience as a resumé, my credentials, contact info, and photos of previous design work. The site is planned to have 3 of pages, consisting of: an “about me” page that serves as a resume, a porfolio with images of my past design work, and a page with contact info. The site branding centers around the color cyan and should use white as a main background color and black as a text and accent color. The logo is a circle and therefore some other elements should potentially be circular where applicable in order to preserve cohesion. The site map will be simple since there are only 3 pages; it will consist of a navigation bar with a button to navigate to one of the other pages. They will be labeled as "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact."</p>
